            What is Social Rent?
          </Header>
          <p style={{ fontSize: '1.33em' }}>
            Social Rent is a marketplace designed to connect social media users with businesses that would like to advertise through social media users’ actual posts. On Social Rent, advertisers can sign up and make posts/ requests on the marketplace.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: '1.33em' }}>
             A Social Rent user can choose to take the post from the advertiser/business and post the ad on their social media outlet, then get paid from the Social Rent Advertiser by click, view, like, retweet, engagement ect.
          </p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: '1.33em' }}>
             Businesses can choose to make a post public or private. A public post will go the the marketplace page with the number of users an advertiser wants to have take the post (e.g. ‘business a wants 100 users to take this ad’), and private posts will be saved to the advertisers account and can be send via message to specific users.

            We exist to provide a marketplace where people who use social media have an opportunity to work with, and get paid
            by the companies and products they support. That being said, it's a two-way street: companies get to work with
            the people who support thier products and pay them to promote the products they support. Call to action here --
