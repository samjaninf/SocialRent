Social Rent is a marketplace designed to connect social media users with businesses that would like to advertise through social media users‚Äô actual posts. On Social Rent, advertisers can sign up and make posts/ requests on the marketplace. A Social Rent user can choose to take the post from the advertiser/business and post the ad on their social media outlet, then get paid from the Social Rent Advertiser by click, view, like, retweet, engagement ect.  Businesses can choose to make a post public or private. A public post will go the the marketplace page with the number of users an advertiser wants to have take the post (e.g. ‚Äòbusiness a wants 100 users to take this ad‚Äô), and private posts will be saved to the advertisers account and can be send via message to specific users.

## Why would anyone want this!?

Celebrities can make in the vicinity of $10k per tweet. Reaching audiences of hundreds of thousands

In 2016 the average twitter user had 707 followers.

This means a business investing "by the click" can put in the same money and reach a more diverse and potentially larger audience through social renting.

## Yeah, but WHY?

in 2017 Business Insider identified two areas of opportunity for Twitter.
1. Create a better return on investment measurement for business
2. Create a better technology for smaller advertisers who can't depend on larger marketing budgets.

SocialRent solves for both of these.
